You can select multiple running processes (left box) at once.

# ***Final thoughts***
> Added a ghetto but usable Light/Dark mode in the settings menu (also new).

> Very fun little project. Originally made it to keep Cortana and msedge from running.

> Obviously you can kill any process you have the rights to so watch what you add!
